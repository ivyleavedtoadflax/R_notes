README

This repo is home to the notes produced for a short course in R run at Cranfield University, designed for researchers currently completing their analyses in other programs. The course is due to be run at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, from August 2013.

Notes for the course can be found in /Tutorial. Users are advised to clone or download the repository and then run index.html from the local folder. Links to the rest of the course are available from there.

The course was written in html and R and compiled using RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/).

This repo is also home to a collection of notes and examples on using particular R functions. These can be found in /Notes. Each sub-directory refers to an individual R command, and provides an example of how to use that command, or it refers to a particular outcome, and includes scripts on how to achieve that outcome: e.g. overlaid_histograms/

Incomplete examples are followed by the suffix '_incomplete'

Html files for examples were created using the 'compile a notebook' function in RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/).
