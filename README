README

This is a repository for general notes on functions and scripts for the statistical programming environment R (http://cran.r-project.org/).

This repo is also home to a short R tutorial course, which can be found in the folder Tutorial/, and was run as part of an 'Introduction to R' course at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, 2013.

Each other directory refers to an individual R command, and provides an example of how to use that command, or it refers to a particular outcome, and includes scripts on how to achieve that outcome: e.g. overlaid_histograms/

Incomplete exampels are followed by the suffix '_incomplete'

Html files for examples were created using the 'compile a notebook' function in RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/)
