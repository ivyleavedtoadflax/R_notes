["installing-r-packages.html", "Chapter 4 Installing R Packages", " Chapter 4 Installing R Packages One of the strengths of R is that there are literally thousands of packages available for you to extend to core capabilities if the R statistical environment. You may one day even with to write your own packages. Downloading and installing packages is a very simple procedure in R and can be done with a single line of code – You will probably do this a lot! Int his instance, we specify the repository from which we will download the package - if you omitted repos=&quot;&quot; then you would be asked to select a repository from a list. Rstudio’s mirror is hosted by amazon, and hence, is pretty fast - so we’ll use that one. install.packages(&#39;agricolae&#39;, repos=&quot;http://cran.rstudio.com/&quot;) R will then download the package and install it in the relevant directory. In order to use the package you need to call the package using library(agricolae). This may or may not generate a message or warning. library(agricolae) If you wanto to suppress warnings (for instance if you wish to call a package from within a function) you can also use require(agricolae) (there are subtle difference between library() and require() – see a good explanation here). Note that you will need to call the package with library() every time you run a new instance of R. Running the install.packages() command will also update a package to the latest available version if you already have that package. "]
