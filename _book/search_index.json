I am simply going to show you HOW to use them in R When running t-tests, there is a simple, built in function we can use. See ?t.test for more information. In this example we will use Crawley’s t.test data from .296 of the R book. t.test.data &lt;- read.table( &quot;http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/research/mjcraw/therbook/data/t.test.data.txt&quot;, header = T ) t.test.data ## gardenA gardenB ## 1 3 5 ## 2 4 5 ## 3 4 6 ## 4 3 7 ## 5 2 4 ## 6 3 4 ## 7 1 3 ## 8 3 5 ## 9 5 6 ## 10 2 5 Remember that we must always satisfy ourselves that the data are normally distributed before completing a t-test, if not, the assumptions of these tests do not hold. You should consider the other assumptions of a t-test too, before you run the test. gardenA &lt;- t.test.data$gardenA gardenB &lt;- t.test.data$gardenB par(mfrow=c(1,2)) qqnorm(gardenA) qqline(gardenA) qqnorm(gardenB) qqline(gardenB) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) OK great…this data looks pretty normal. Let’s complete the t.test() In this example we have assumed that the gardens are paired plots, and that we are interested in a two sided test. If you are not sure what is meant by these terms, you should read up on it before attempting to complete the test: Wikipedia is a surprisingly good resource for statistical information. t.test( x = gardenA, y = gardenB, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, paired = TRUE ) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: gardenA and gardenB ## t = -6.7082, df = 9, p-value = 8.771e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.674445 -1.325555 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -2 The output gives us the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, and the -value - simple. Note that if you want to automate t.test, or another test, you can extract the results from the test object like so: example_test &lt;-t.test( x = gardenA, y = gardenB, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, paired = TRUE ) example_test$statistic ## t ## -6.708204 example_test$parameter ## df ## 9 example_test$.value ## NULL So yes….it appears that our two samples are significantly different, because the test statistic is greater than our critical t value. We can can calculate the critical t value to check this: qt( 0.975, # 0.975 because it is a two tailed test and 2*(1-0.975) = 0.05! df = 9 ) ## [1] 2.262157 # We ignore signs in a two-sided t-test, hence if the absolute value of the test # statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis: abs(example_test$statistic) &gt; qt(0.975,9) ## t ## TRUE Easy!
