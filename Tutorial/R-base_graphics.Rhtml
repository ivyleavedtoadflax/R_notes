<h1>R-base graphics</h1>

<p>R-base is the basic set of functions that come with R as standard - before you start to download any additional packages. The graphics functions included in R-base are simple, but also highly customisable, and capable of producing high standard, publication quality graphics.</p>

<p>There are other graphics packages which offer more advanced graphical functions like <b>ggplot2</b>, these will not be covered in this course.</p>

<h2>Producing a basic plot</h2>

<p>The basic plotting functions are very easy, but we first need some data to work with. We'll refer to some of the data used in the R book again.</p>

<p>As before, we import directly from an online text file</p>

<!--begin.rcode
sapdecay <- read.table(
     "http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/research/mjcraw/therbook/data/sapdecay.txt", 
     header=T
     )
end.rcode-->

<p> We'll call the data to examine it. Note this data is dealt with on p70 of 'The R Book'. remember that typing the name of the object <tt>sapdecay</tt> is the 'short-hand' equivalent of typing <tt>print(sapdecay)</tt> - there are certain occasions when it will be necessary to use the full command - more of that later.</p>

<!--begin.rcode
sapdecay
end.rcode-->

<p>So, we have two columns of data, which we will plots against each other - this is very simple</p>

<!--begin.rcode
plot(sapdecay)
end.rcode-->

<p>In this example, R recognises that there are two columns in the object sapdecay, and it simply plots them against each other. This kind of command is called a lazy command, because we have not specified any of the arguments explicitly.</p>

<p>The long version would be:</p>

<!--begin.rcode
plot(
     x = sapdecay$x,
     y = sapdecay$y
     )

# Note that we can also dispence with the sapdecay$ by using the with() command:

with(
     sapdecay,
     plot(
          x = x,
          y = y
          )
     )
     

end.rcode-->

<p>This isn't a particularly inspiring plot, so let's make it look a little better...</p>

<p>First let's make it a little easier to see al the changes that we are making</p>

<!--begin.rcode


# First let's make it a little easier to see al the changes that we are making

par(mfrow = c(2,2)) 

# This command splits the plotting area into four, so we can see four plots side
# by side. We'll cover the par command in more detail in the next section. We
# then simply make four plots, one after the other, and they will fill up the
# plotting area.

with(
     sapdecay,
     plot(
          x = x,
          y = y,
          xlab = "Time (hours)",
          ylab = "Decay rate",
          type = "l",
          col = "red",
          lwd = 2,
          main = "Line"
          )
     )

with(
     sapdecay,
     plot(
          x = x,
          y = y,
          xlab = "Time (hours)",
          ylab = "Decay rate",
          type = "o",
          col = "green",
          lwd = 1,
          main = "Overplot"
          )
     )

with(
     sapdecay,
     plot(
          x = x,
          y = y,
          xlab = "Time (hours)",
          ylab = "Decay rate",
          type = "h",
          col = "blue",
          lwd = 2,
          main = "Histogram"
          )
     )

with(
     sapdecay,
     plot(
          x = x,
          y = y,
          xlab = "Time (hours)",
          ylab = "Decay rate",
          type = "s",
          col = "hotpink",
          lwd = 2,
          main = "Step"
          )
     )

# It's important that we reset the mfrow parameter at the end of plotting,
# otherwise all subsequent plots will apear on this four by four grid, which may
# not be what we want.

par(mfrow = c(1,1))

end.rcode-->

<p>Using this method, it's also perfectly possible to combine plots of two different types, and plot them next to each other.</p>

<p>Let's imagine that we want to test whether a variable is normally distributed - there are two very simple graphical commands built into R that make this easier: <tt>qqnorm</tt> and <tt>qqplot</tt>. These commands produce quantile-quantile plots for the normal distribution. Essentially if the data are normally distributed, they will conform to the straight line<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>First we will create a vector of random numbers drawn from a normal distribution - so we already know that they are normal!</p>

<!--begin.rcode
normal_data <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=1)

normal_data
end.rcode-->

<p>And now...some plots. First, two plots side by side.</p>

<!--begin.rcode

par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 

# Remember that the first number is the number of rows, the latter is the number
# of columns. So here, we have specified one row, two columns...

# Now the plots:

hist(normal_data)

qqnorm(normal_data)
qqline(normal_data)
end.rcode-->

<p>So things should look pretty normal. In this example we have not specified a 'seed' (see <tt>?set.seed</tt> for more info). So every time that you run the code, you will get a different set of randomly generated numbers drawn from a normal distribution.</p>

<p>All well and good, but what about one above the other? Just changed the one and 2 around in the <tt>par(mfrow=c(x,y))</tt> command.</p>

<!--begin.rcode

par(mfrow=c(2,1)) 

# Remember that the first number is the number of rows, the latter is the number
# of columns. So here, we have specified one row, two columns...

# Now the plots:

hist(normal_data)

qqnorm(normal_data)
qqline(normal_data)
end.rcode-->

<p>Easy right?</p>

<h2>Customising your plots</h2>

<p>There are a number of arguments that can be passed to the plot commands in order to customise your plots. The below list is lifted from the help file for the <tt>?plot.default</tt> command. You can normally get similar lists of possible arguments for other commands: e.g. <tt>?hist</tt>.</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>1-character string giving the type of plot desired.  The
following values are possible, for details, see <code>plot</code>:
<code>"p"</code> for points, <code>"l"</code> for lines,
<code>"b"</code> for both points and lines,
<code>"c"</code> for empty points joined by lines,
<code>"o"</code> for overplotted points and lines,
<code>"s"</code> and <code>"S"</code> for stair steps and
<code>"h"</code> for histogram-like vertical lines.  Finally,
<code>"n"</code> does not produce any points or lines.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xlim</code></td>
<td>
<p>the x limits (x1, x2) of the plot.  Note that <code>x1 &gt; x2</code>
is allowed and leads to a &lsquo;reversed axis&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The default value, <code>NULL</code>, indicates that the range of the finite values to be plotted should be used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ylim</code></td>
<td>
<p>the y limits of the plot.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>log</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string which contains <code>"x"</code> if the x axis
is to be logarithmic, <code>"y"</code> if the y axis is to be logarithmic
and <code>"xy"</code> or <code>"yx"</code> if both axes are to be logarithmic.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
<p>a main title for the plot, see also <code>title</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sub</code></td>
<td>
<p>a sub title for the plot.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xlab</code></td>
<td>
<p>a label for the x axis, defaults to a description of <code>x</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ylab</code></td>
<td>
<p>a label for the y axis, defaults to a description of <code>y</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ann</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value indicating whether the default annotation
(title and x and y axis labels) should appear on the plot.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>axes</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value indicating whether both axes should be drawn on
the plot.  Use graphical parameter <code>"xaxt"</code> or <code>"yaxt"</code>
to suppress just one of the axes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>frame.plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating whether a box should be drawn
around the plot.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>panel.first</code></td>
<td>
<p>an &lsquo;expression&rsquo; to be evaluated after the
plot axes are set up but before any plotting takes place.  This can
be useful for drawing background grids or scatterplot smooths.  Note
that this works by lazy evaluation: passing this argument from other
<code>plot</code> methods may well not work since it may be evaluated too
early.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>panel.last</code></td>
<td>
<p>an expression to be evaluated after plotting has
taken place but before the axes, title and box are added.  See the
comments about <code>panel.first</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>asp</code></td>
<td>
<p>the <i>y/x</i> aspect ratio, see <code>plot.window</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>other graphical parameters (see <code>par</code> and
section &lsquo;Details&rsquo; below).</p>
</td></tr>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>If you have time, try customising some of the previous plots by altering some of these arguments for yourself...</p>

<p>Below is a plot produced using the <tt>normal_data</tt> vector we produced earlier. See if you can reproduce it by changing the arguments listed above.</p>

<!--begin.rcode echo=FALSE,fig.height=6
plot(normal_data)
end.rcode-->
